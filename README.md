# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
A website built by me for recognizing emotion from an audio input using Librosa, Soundfile and various other python libraries. For building the machine learning model, I have used SKlearn's MLP Classifier with an accuracy of about 83%. The languages used for the frontend and backend are HTML, CSS, Javascript and flask.
